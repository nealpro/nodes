# nodes

Blazingly fast mindmaps on many platforms with intuitive defaults. Inspired by `vim` and `h-m-m`.

## Features

- Freeform mode: Multiple mindmaps can co-exist on the same plane with nodes that can move anywhere freely.

- Arranged and paginated mode: Free nodes are arranged into a structure starting at an edge. Root nodes move to an edge, and roots are paginated with your sorting criteria.

- All nodes are files (that are markdown by default.) Types can be selected.

- All actions can ideally be triggered by the keyboard.

## Future

- Scripting language for customization.
